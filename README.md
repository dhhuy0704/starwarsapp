# Star Wars App
Small project for interview

## Overview
We believe the best way to assess a developerâ€™s ability and skillset is by seeing their code. This can either be applications, projects, services, or scripts you have previously written that you are proud to share or by implementing something new such as one of the two mini projects below. The code cannot be group based.
Star Wars API SDK

Implement a Star Wars API SDK. The SDK can be built for any platform (web, iOS, Android, etc.) using any language; whatever you are most comfortable with.

Implement a Star Wars info application. The application can be built for any platform (web, iOS, Android, etc.) using any language and framework(s) other than Ruby on Rails; whatever you are most comfortable with. The application should display a list of films and upon selecting a film display details for the film: metadata, characters, vehicles, planets, etc.
The visual aesthetics of the app are not of importance, we will only be reviewing your code for coding style, clarity, design, architecture, robustness to handle bad data and errors, etc.

## Requirements
- Use Star Wars API ( https://swapi.dev )
- Films list page that displays list of all films
- Film detail page that displays film metadata, characters, vehicles, planets, etc.

## Bonus Points
- Implement one or more detail pages for characters, vehicles, planets, etc. The detail pages should be accessible from the film detail page
- Implement client side search filter on the films list page to filter displayed films by title, or description

## Questions
- Assuming the Star Wars API was slow, what are some optimizations that could be implemented to improve the user experience?
- Any improvements you would make to your application?

## Time
- One week to complete
